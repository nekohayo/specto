Specto is a desktop application that will **watch configurable events** (such as website updates, emails, file and folder changes, system processes, etc) and then **trigger notifications**. For example, Specto can watch a website for updates (or a syndication feed, or an image, etc), and notify you when there is activity (otherwise, Specto will just _stay out of the way_). This changes the way you work, because you can _be informed of events instead of having to look out for them_.

**Specto is unmaintained**. See details here: http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2013/03/21/a-programs-obsolescence/

**For users upgrading from Specto 0.2.x to 0.3.x**: use _File > Import watches_ to import your old watches from ~/.specto/ (the directory and format has changed).
