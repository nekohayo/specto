As the confirmation dialog will tell you, **this cannot be undone**. We can not be held responsible if a herd of flying mammoths come and trash your house.

If you are looking to stop a watch from being updated, but not remove it from the watch list, see ActivatingAndDeactivatingWatches instead.

# Opening the watch for editing #
In the notifier window, left-click on a watch in the list to display an information pane at the bottom of the window. In that pane, click the "edit" button. Check that you really are about to remove the watch you wanted to remove, and click the remove button. **This action cannot be undone.**
