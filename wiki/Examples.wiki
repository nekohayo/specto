= What websites would Specto be useful for? =
You could use these links to make specto watch those pages, to be advised when a new package is availble for download for example, or when the wiki is updated, etc.

  * wiki (individual pages): http://specto.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/
  * downloads: http://code.google.com/p/specto/downloads/list
  * bugs and requests: http://code.google.com/p/specto/issues/list
  * changes on the website: http://specto.sourceforge.net
  * random test page: http://randize.com
  * changes in version control systems: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~specto/specto/main/changes (though there is now a specialized Bazaar watch in Specto 0.3)
...and so on.
